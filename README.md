# ZomboidImportExport
Blender 2.79 import/export addon for Project Zomboid files.
Please Note, as of right now importing via the context menu will not work, you must run the addon as a script to import a mesh, exporting should be fine. 
To run import script in blender, change to the 'Text Editor' View, then open the ZomboidImportNew script and click run, then you will be able to chose a model to import.  

Notes for 2.8x - 2.9
I began to work on updating plugins to 2.8x or 2.9, but its a long process, I do not think that texture exporting/importing or UV map exporting/importing will work, I have no tested, I only have tested import/export of the mesh, and it still throws some errors but mostly was working.
