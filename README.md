# ZomboidImportExport
Blender 2.79 import/export addon for Project Zomboid files, probably does not work with 2.8+ because scene becomes 'view_layer' I think and I don't use 2.8+ sorry. 
Please Note, as of right now importing via the context menu will not work, you must run the addon as a script to import a mesh, exporting should be fine. 
To run import script in blender, change to the 'Text Editor' View, then open the ZomboidImportNew script and click run, then you will be able to chose a model to import.
